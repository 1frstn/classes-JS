# A runtime environment is where your program will be executed. JavaScript code may be executed in one of two runtime environments: a browser’s runtime environment the Node runtime environment
# In each of these environments, different data values and functions are available, and these differences help distinguish front-end applications from back-end applications.

# Front-end JavaScript applications are executed in a browser’s runtime environment and have access to the window object.

# Back-end JavaScript applications are executed in the Node runtime environment and have access to the file system, databases, and networks attached to the server.

<!-- module.exports -->
# module.exports is an object that is built-in to the Node.js runtime environment. Other files can now import this object, and make use of these two functions, with another feature that is built-in to the Node.js runtime environment: the require() function.
